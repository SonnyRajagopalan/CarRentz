Hello Narendra,

Thank you for the opportunity to interview with State Street. Attached, please 
find a zip file with two files--one a markdown (Design.md) showing my very initial 
thoughts about the design of this solution (it is evolving by the minute), and 
another a python file showing the simulation. You can run the simulation with 
python3 on your desktop (requires terminal access) like so:

	$ python3 ./simulateCarRentRentals.py 10 10
	Simulating 10 customers for 10 days
	Customer 9189152 is renting Sedan for a duration of 4 days
	Customer 7580732 is renting SUV for a duration of 7 days
	Customer 5667387 is renting Sedan for a duration of 1 days
	Ran out of Sedans for 2134724, helping next customer...
	Customer 285458 is renting SUV for a duration of 6 days
	Ran out of Sedans for 3000746, helping next customer...
	Customer 3911181 is renting SUV for a duration of 12 days
	Customer 8047414 is renting Van for a duration of 12 days
	Customer 8336240 is renting SUV for a duration of 14 days
	Ran out of Vans for 5521319, helping next customer...
	Customer 5667387 has returned the Sedan. Total Sedans: 1, SUVs: 1, Vans: 0
	Customer 9189152 has returned the Sedan. Total Sedans: 2, SUVs: 1, Vans: 0
	Customer 285458 has returned the SUV. Total Sedans: 2, SUVs: 2, Vans: 0
	Customer 7580732 has returned the SUV. Total Sedans: 2, SUVs: 3, Vans: 0
	Customer 3911181 has returned the SUV. Total Sedans: 2, SUVs: 4, Vans: 0
	Customer 8047414 has returned the Van. Total Sedans: 2, SUVs: 4, Vans: 1
	Customer 8336240 has returned the SUV. Total Sedans: 2, SUVs: 5, Vans: 1

Please note that I am not calling the python file an OOP approach (more on that in 
the design document). I am going to start work on the OOP approach shortly, but 
wanted to send you this initial cut by today.

That said, I have to confess calling the requested prep work a simulation has me a 
little torn on a number of accounts. For starters, a simulation does not need to 
be scalable in the same manner as production grade systems, and the design 
criteria and maintainability criteria both differ (I am delighted to talk about 
this, having done a lot of simulations and production grade code in extremely 
demanding telco systems in my past life). However, this work will help me on a 
side project I have been working on (simulating the stock market--I had spoken to 
Dimitry about it) so I am doubly happy to start work on it (I am currently working 
on setting up a k3s system on my local Raspberry Pi network).

Last: this work has not relied on any Generative AI resources online except 
CoPilot on my Visual Studio Code (I am learning how to use it). I _could_ use 
ChatGPT or Claude, but I'd rather have the fun :-).

Anyway, I am working on a more detailed simulation/OOP design before we meet. In 
the interim, please reach out if you have any questions.

Cheers,
Sonny.
